Provides the remote coarse-grained facade service interfaces (and serializable implementations) to the CM Client.

NOTE: this package will likely move to a new project.
It is currently living in core until a new project is created for it to move to.  This project would have 
compile-time dependencies from CM Server and the CM Client (with the implementations living in the CM Server).
Do not add extra dependencies to classes in this package unless from the CM Server or CM Client.

@since 6.2.1
